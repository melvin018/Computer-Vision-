# Computer Vision Group--B

## Assignment 1: Computer Vision

**Deadline:** Week 7, June 13, 23:59

**Group Members:**
- Ankit
- Jasdeep
- Cristeena
- Dhvani
- Ashtami
- Sarath
- Parmeet
- Anjali
- Melvin
- Ajit

### Instructions:

For this assignment, you will be working on a series of Jupyter Notebooks to implement and understand various machine learning models for computer vision. The assignment is divided into four main parts, each focusing on a different model. Please follow the steps below in the given order to complete the assignment:

1. **Complete `knn.ipynb`:** Ankit, Jasdeep
2. **Complete `svm.ipynb`:** Cristeena, Dhvani, Ashtami
3. **Complete `softmax.ipynb`:** Melvin, Ajit
4. **Complete `two_layer_net.ipynb`:** Sarath, Parmeet, Anjali

### Submission Guidelines:
- Ensure that each notebook (and python script) is fully completed and all cells are executed without errors.
- Save each completed notebook with all outputs visible.
- Convert each `.ipynb` file to a `.py` format for ease of use.
- Push the completed notebooks and the corresponding `.py` files to the GitHub repo.
- Your GitHub repo should be private.

### Important Notes:
- Start working on the assignment early to ensure you have ample time to understand each concept and debug your code.
- If you encounter any issues or have questions, do not hesitate to ask for assistance.

### Assignment Completion Status:
- `knn.ipynb`: Completed by Ankit, Jasdeep
- `svm.ipynb`: Completed by Cristeena, Dhvani, Ashtami
- `softmax.ipynb`: Completed by Melvin, Ajit
- `two_layer_net.ipynb`: Completed by Sarath, Parmeet, Anjali

### Confirmation:
All group members have completed their parts and the assignment is complete. The completed notebooks and the corresponding `.py` files have been pushed to the private GitHub repository.
